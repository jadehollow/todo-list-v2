# ToDo List v2
A clean and easy-to-use ToDo List built using NodeJS, EJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Version 2 has been changed and upgraded from the first version by implementing a database via Mongo/Mongoose functionality to store the ToDo List items and separate lists. New lists can now be created dynamically by the user and items can be deleted instead of only being crossed off.
